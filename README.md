# abstract-machines

Some code artifacts that I collected along the
way in studying Abstract Interpretation theories
and PL in general.

None of the artifacts is immediately useful to
the real world. You could think of each modules,
folders here are trying to escape this repo by
manifesting itself as a working static analysis
tool or paper ([either] for a compiler phase, or
verifying programs).

As for the repo itself, from day one it has
served as an online backup storage that does
signal my interests to the internet.
Happy to discuss!
