observations I'm not terribly sure about:
- Kont is also Storable along with Value(Env); atomic evaluation can yield Kont
- the adj "abstract" in abstract time-stamped cesk* means we use stack data structures
  in tick and alloc instead of first-class functions
- https://smlhelp.github.io/book/docs/concepts/control-flow/cps is a valuable resource
    - may have the breadth for an instructive material, but writing style is uninspiring
