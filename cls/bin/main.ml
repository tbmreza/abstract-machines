(* STEPS

First spelling out the match cases poorly:
  a. abs head, control tail; pop l; the 2 combine for new s head
  b. app head, reform control with ap sequence; l pushes its own head; s unchanged
  c. index closest to binder; pop l; push its term to s
  d. index n, pred n; pop l, push its tail back to l; s unchanged
  e. ap labeled, control (second s) term; push l with that term * env; (cddr s)

Now for intuition:
  a. Abstraction term means that it can jump together with the topmost env to s.
  b. We spread application of terms as its constituents followed with special AP as a marker.
     Now if the state that we entered this step with has e as topmost env, in the next state that e is duplicated to accommodate for the application that we spreaded.
  c. 0 means index is closest to its lambda binder. Topmost value in the l can jump to s.
  d. With base condition specified, now we look to pred index n. We'll handle the topmost value in the base case, so we have to pop it for now.
  e. AP instructs that topmost term in s jumps to c, topmost value jumps to l together with the env beneath it. This step dances with step b.
